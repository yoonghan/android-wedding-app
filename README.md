# The first app written with React Native back in 2016
---
This is a prototype react native app written as wedding invitation and I'm releasing it for view. The idea revolves in:
1. Firstly, the user will need a QR code attached with the wedding card.
2. This app is then downloaded, and can be accessed only with the given QR Code
3. There is also a running server that verifies the QR code, but well, that's not really important.

## Usage
1. Download the source file
2. Run with the command on a real actual device. The QR Code not work with emulator.
```
 react-native run-android
```
3. Enjoy the app. The QR code are attached in qrcode/ folder.
